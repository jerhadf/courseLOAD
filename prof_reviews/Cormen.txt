"Huge workload and extremely hard. I think you really need to have a background in CS or some natural god given ability to thrive in this class Do not take this course with other hard classes. Cormen has tough grading rubric as well. Overall, super rewarding and interesting course, but do not expect an easy time.",
"He's a good professor but it's a 190 student class, and there's virtually no interaction between the prof and the students except for the questions. The class period tends to get very boring very fast. It's a nice if you're trying to experience new fields in your freshman year, but I would not recommend taking it for a distributive. The workload is heavy. I agree that you should have a natural talent or CS background to achieve high grades in this course.",
"Hard AF! Prof Cormen is good but very demanding class especially if you have not taken any CS before. Do not take with 2 other tough classes - many withdrew.",
" Came into CS1 with absolutely no prior experience. If you are interested in CS and find logical/problem-solving puzzles as satisfying as I do, you will be able to do well if you just put in a few hours of extra studying a week (usually just 1-2 for me). Sometimes I felt pretty behind compared to other students with lots of prior experience (especially after the first midterm), but I can definitely say that if you read the lectures Cormen posts on the website, go to section more often then not, and are reasonably intellectually competent, you can easily pull out a B+/A- in this class.", 
"Half of the class had prior coding experience. During first midterm half of the room completed it within an hour, while another half was there for 3 hours. I'm afraid in order to get something close to B- you have to learn Python on your own PRIOR to enrolling into this course. I expected it to be intro course, but ended up dropping it after week 3. First 2 weeks were intro and very deceiving. Grading system is strange. Your lab assignments and homework can change your grade only to plus or minus while grade by itself is based on the 3 exams. To get A you need 98% on exams and above 90% on labs I believe. Prof Cormen is funny guy, but tough. Unless you want to major in CS or have Python knowledge AVOID.", 
"Definitely not a class for the faint of heart. You will get stuck debugging for hours. You will find your eyelids drooping as Cormen regales you with the amazing story of how RSA encryption was thought of by a drunk guy. And the tests will make you think that you're taking literature instead of CS (SO MUCH READING). But in the end, its probably worth it, if you're actually interested in CS. Definitely rougher if you've had no CS experience at all as you go from printing out your name in week 1 to encrypting/decrypting files in week 9. Also a bit of a weeder course (at least 20% of the original class dropped out). In the end though, it is really what you make of it. Cormen gives many interesting/frustrating (depending on your viewpoint) extra credit opportunities on the labs that allow you to explore a little beyond class material. If you're just trying to get by though, you could probably learn all the material by just reading the online notes and textbook (project python) as his lectures are essentially 90% that, along with some random, completely irrelevant stories that he just likes to throw in. Do go early to lab section hours if you get stuck debugging as this will save you SO MUCH time and the line usually starts early. And finally, don't forget the three things a constructor does.... Also, laughing at all these salty dropouts who wrote shit reviews abt dis course XD",
"Probably the worst class I have ever taken and it's all because of the prof: 1) He has a bullshit grading rubric, which basically makes all the homework count for basically nothing 2) His exams are unnecessarily wordy, which makes them unnecessarily difficult The material is really interesting, just take it with ANY other prof and you will have a great time.",
"I took this course with Prof. Cormen my freshman fall (and was a section leader with Cormen and Farid other times) and I can't recommend it more highly. It is an amazing class for anyone even marginally interested in CS or math or just learning how to think differently. The workload is manageable if you start early and go in for help (the section leaders are always available to help you!)",
"Course: Great course, definitely take it even if you dont have interest in majoring in anything that requires cosc. develops an appreciation for something that is all around us Professor: Cormen is incredibly smart and has a lot of experience. He is also very helpful and his course is very well structured. Workload: There's a good amount of work in CS 1 but nothing too bad, definitely manageable if you're not taking two killer courses with it.",
"Course: Very interesting, but very fast paced. It's hard to keep up a lot of the time, and the material doesn't stop for you. If you don't have a background in CS, get ready for a ride. Professor: Cormen is the smartest dick you will ever meet here. He's incredibly arrogant, but still deserves to be so. Don't ever argue for points though, you won't get anything out of him. In fact, he prides himself in taking more points than he gives if you request a regrade. Stay on his good side though and you'll find yourself with a lot of research opportunities. Workload: SO MUCH FUCKING WORK. I've taken some tough classes here and this beats them all in terms of workload. The labs take 10-12 hours to do, and there are frequent short assignments. Plus, the exams are actually pretty hard.",
"I had never done any computer science before so i was apprehensive but i really likes this class. We learned how to do a lot of cool stuff and some interesting ideas about computer science, and, considering that i had started with no knowledge in the subject whatsoever, made the class very satisfying. Some of the homework is kind of busy work but most tests your skills very well. there is a quiz before almost every test and i did really badly on them all, but they showed me what i needed to work on so i could perform well on the tests. you definitely don't need the back and you don't even need to go to class, all the notes are perfectly documented online. it helps to go to the lectures though, cormen explains things really well. take this class!",
"Cormen is inconsiderate about how much work he gives. In the span of two weeks this term we had a lab, a quiz, and a midterm, which are all totally consuming. Also, there is NO TIME to get behind. If you take this course, learn EVERYTHING from the beginning. Otherwise you'll be in a lot of trouble and totally miserable. Otherwise, he's a pretty good lecturer although there is no real effective way to take notes. You need to be able to write out code/drawings with pencil but he goes to fast to handwrite everything. Luckily he posts the notes online, so even if you miss things, you can look back. And you will miss things. Overall, one of the hardest classes I've taken. If you're not a computer person now, you will be. Or you'll have to drop the class.",
"This course is pretty good and manageable, just don't fall behind. It's pretty reasonable as long as it's your 1st/2nd priority as a course. If you're taking other math/science + other demanding courses it's probably not a good combo. If you're looking to learn a bit about programming, it's useful. Cormen's a good prof, especially in office hours which really can help. The undergrad TA's are also good, they helped immensely with the short assignments and labs. Also, try to take advantage of the grad TA office hours, they can come in handy. The book is useful if you have the time to read it, otherwise Cormen's notes will suffice. It is a beast of a challenge though, only take it if you have the time.",
"Lots and lots of work.....lab assignments will kill you if you don't start them early enough....but it's a good class and you learn a TON about programming... I hadn't taken any CS classes before and knew NOTHING about programming and now I feel a lot more comfortable and the assignments that looked challenging at first now seem really easy.",
"This class was amazing! I really enjoyed the material that was covered in this class. The only bad part of the course was when Professor Cormen had two guest lecturers who were grad students that he was testing out speak. They weren't very good. Other than that, everything about this course was remarkable. Many people found this course to be challenging, but if you enjoy the material and subject matter like I did, you will have no trouble with it. This was actually one of my easiest classes this term.",
"So I came into this class with a bad attitude because I wasn't supposed to take it -- I'm an ENGS major and had been planning on taking ENGS 20 as my computer prereq, but it didn't fit in my schedule, so I had to take CS 5 instead. From the beginning, I kept thinking "Oh, this class will be so useless... I'm not learning anything engineering-related." However, this bad attitude started to fade away as the term went on. I started to actually enjoy programming by the end of it, especially since the lab assignments [although quite hard and reallyyyy time-consuming] were kind of fun. It was awesome to learn how to make the computer do what you want. Professor Cormen is an excellent professor, making what is inherently not the most exciting topic quite entertaining at times. He's an extremely fair prof and is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS available for help. Definitely take advantage of that! it's not too often that profs reply to blitzes at 11pm on Saturdays! And the homework assignments REALLY helped me understand the material, except my one complaint is that they were far too time-consuming. I spent so much of my life on CS this term -- way more than I would have liked. So be prepared to learn a lot, and perhaps to even learn to like programming, but to also put tons of work into this class. I'd say it's worth it.",
"Cormen was a great professor, and the class was extremely well done. I do think that the class somewhat favored people who had the time to do extra credit though (I was really busy this term, so it screwed me over on extra credit). There are kids in this class where this is all that they do, so it can be competitive, but the material is not hard at all.",
"This was by far my favorite class this term! Professor Cormen is an amazing professor and he makes the course content so interesting! He is very sensitive to student concerns and makes an effort to get to know everyone in the class. You learn Java in this class and there is a lot of focus on good form and coding practice. I think this course really changes the way you think and if you can, definitely take this class! You will have 3 quizzes and 3 exams during the year, so the course is broken up (there isn't too much pressure for each quiz/exam). There are around 16 short assignments and 5 labs. The course is definitely fast-paced and pretty demanding, but if you try, you will definitely enjoy it!",
"don't buy the book or do readings - just go to all the lectures. Practical, interesting, but a LOT of work - be prepared to live in Sudikoff. Attend recitation - it helps with the labs. Great teacher lectures well & is very responsive & helpful (even if you blitz him at 1 AM on the weekend about the assignments or labs. Too bad he'll be on sabbatical for the next 2 years. Online notes and instructions are very thorough and easy to understand. You don't need previous programming exp or knowledge of comp sci, although it might help",
"Computer Science 5 was by far the best class that I took this term. Cormen was a great lecturer and conveyed the material very well. The material itself was useful, covering the basics of computer science from the ground up. The labs were hard, but fun to do and very rewarding. Highly recommend this class for anyone interested in computer science or analytical thinking.",
"This class is pretty interesting, and actually a bit of fun if you have any interest in programming. Most of the enjoyment comes out of doing the labs, where I found myself doing the extra credit just because it was a bit of a challenge. However, lectures are very slow, and definitely oriented towards freshmen, who make up the majority of the class. Not bad for an intro course where people come from very diverse skill backgrounds, but I think Cormen babies people too much by having them turn in short assignments almost every class and having an asinine lateness policy.",
"Professor Cormen knows his stuff. In this course you learn the basics of using Java to create small programs that do things like sort lists and draw basic graphics. While this course might lead into some useful, fun stuff, as of yet I haven't seen much return for all the hard work I put in except a few dinky little graphical outputs. That said, when you look back on how difficult it was to do anything, you realize you learned a lot in this course. As a warning, watch out for falling behind/handing things in late; they do NOT cut you any slack. That said, Cormen and the TA's are very available for help. I once got an email back from Professor Cormen at 12 midnight. Play by the rules, keep up with the course, and you will do well.",
"Coming into this course with absolutely no background in Computer Science and an aversion to programming in general, I was shocked how much I enjoyed this course. It's a lot of work, and my Wendesday nights were shot since we had quizzes or exams the majority of Thursday, but you get a lab distrib without having to actually go to lab, and the work is fun as well as rewarding. Cormen is also an AMAZING prof, making the material accessible to everyone, since there is a supremely varied amount of experience amongst the students coming into the course. Constant tests & assignments mean that if you fall behind you're in big trouble, but as long as you stay on top of your work and are willing to work hard it's very possible to do well.",
"Cormen is a great teacher. He provides all of his notes online - the notes, and his lectures, are very clear, straightforward, and effective at explaining material which can often be quite complex. Cormen also manages to keep the lectures entertaining with demonstrations and corny jokes. My only complaint with Cormen is that he can be somewhat sarcastic when aswering students' questions in class, which doesn't exactly motivate kids to ask for help. I found writing code (Java) to be a very enjoyable experience. I enjoyed that it felt like solving a logic puzzle, and when I finally got a program to work I felt like a Godly Creator.",
"You will be worked in this class and worked hard. Do not take this course as a distrib killer; you should only take it if you have some interest in computer science. Make sure you use all of the resources. Prof. Cormen is an amazing resource who makes himself really available. DO NOT GET BEHIND IN THIS COURSE! That is the key to your success.",
"Professor Cormen really made this class great. He was an interesting lecturer and also posted nicely formated notes on the web before every class so you could review them or not go to lecture if needed.",
"Definitely a good deal of work, but the material's interesting, Cormen's a good professor, and coding can be addicting. If you're unsure about the courseload, throw an NRO on it. Of course, that doesn't mean you can get away not doing work - especially given that the only way to learn programming is to get dirty coding Java.",
" Prof. Cormen loves teaching CS 5, and he's good at it. The only problem is that you need to know how to take the class. First, do NOT buy the textbook. It's a waste of money and you really do not need it. He has every lecture written out for you on the internet, WORD FOR WORD, including the jokes he makes. Print all the lectures out because it's all you will need. Do the extra credit, because my 88.88% final grade got me a B and he would have bumped it if I did extra credit. Watch out if you are not a computer science person, because lots of freshman come into the classing knowing a lot and do very well to raise the medians. Use your TA's, they help you tremendously. Good class, boring lectures, a little fast paced, a lot of work, but you learn how to get it done."
"This was by far one of the best classes I've had at Dartmouth. Cormen was amazing. I def recommend taking the class with him but i head he was taking his sabbatical next year so he won't teach this class for the next year. The class is a lot of work but it is very fun. You shouldn't put things off until the last minute because that will screw you over. Go to the lab if you need help because the TAs were very helpful. His quizzes were a little tricky on purpose but if you know the info, you will make a good grade in the class. Also, there is extra credit in the class so you can either get bumped up if you are on the edge or get a citation."
